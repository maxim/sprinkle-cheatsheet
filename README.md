Sprinkle Cheatsheet
===================

[Sprinkle](http://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle/) provides a convenient DSL for setting up your server. I decided to use it for my servers, and wrote this cheatsheet for reference. Hope it's useful for someone out there.

## To do

Feel free to contribute these, or anything else you find missing.

- List missing installers (I only listed the ones I use).
- List missing verifiers (same as above).
- Explain options better.
